Torrent
=======
A BitTorrent implementation written in Elixir.


Documentation
-------------
`ex_doc` is included as a development dependency, so the `mix docs` command should be available after the project has been bootstrapped using `mix deps.get`.

As the entire project the documentation is under development, but I (Martin) aspire to make maintain it as the project grow, to document the design decisions and general usage.
